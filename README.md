# 🚀 My HTML & CSS Journey

Welcome to my repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my evolution in web development. Here I store all my practices, starting from the fundamentals of HTML5 and CSS3 to more complex layouts.

## 📂 Project Gallery

* **[Tribute Page: Rex Orange County](./Tribute-Project)** - A tribute page practicing advanced positioning (`fixed`, `absolute`), CSS layers (`z-index`), and semantic HTML5 tags (`figure`, `blockquote`).
* **[Form Lab (Coming Soon)](#)** - Focusing on inputs, labels, and form styling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure and web standards.
- **CSS3:** Box Model, Positioning, Typography, and Visual Effects.
